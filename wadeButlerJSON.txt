1. It took me roughly 4-6 hours to do the test, If I had more time to do the test I would do three changes
     first - improve the overall style and look, not very appealing.
     second - a task was to have the cuisine type and restaurant rating, but the OpenTable API I was told to use didn't have these features 
                    so I would add the yelp fusion API and add these features.
     third - expand the apps general functionality which would allow more thorough testing.

2. The most useful feature added to react for me in this test was the use of Redux, I've never used it in a project prior to this, lots of 
    boilerplate but the use of a global state is very useful.

3. Tracking down performance issues in production, I haven't done this professionally but I have for my own personal projects. the process 
    I usually take is,
    first - google the error showing in the console and see if that yielded results
    second - if step one doesn't show anything then I break down each component into smaller sections until the bug/error is found

4. The API I was given was simple and easy to use, two improvements would be,
    first - the name section also included the city when there is already a section with that info seems redundant
    second - more information in general ex. cuisine types, the signature dish, etc.
